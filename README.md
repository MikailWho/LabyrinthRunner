# LabyrinthRunner
Labyrinth Runner is a horror-themed game developed as the final project for the 3D Animation and Computer Graphics course at my campus.

The game revolves around navigating a maze while avoiding a roaming pocong (a traditional Indonesian ghost) that adds to the eerie atmosphere. The objective is to escape the maze without being caught by the pocong.

The game features:

Horror-Themed Maze: A spooky and immersive environment designed using Blender.
Roaming Pocong: A haunting character that roams the maze and adds suspense to the gameplay.
Character Design: Custom 3D models and animations for the pocong created using Blender.
Game Logic: Interactive gameplay and enemy behavior designed using UPBGEâ€™s Logic Bricks and Logic Nodes.
Technologies Used:
UPBGE for game engine and game logic
Blender for 3D modeling, character design, and environment design
This project demonstrates my ability to integrate 3D animation, game logic, and gameplay mechanics, developed during the course.
